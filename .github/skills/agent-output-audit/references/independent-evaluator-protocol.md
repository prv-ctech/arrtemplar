# Independent Evaluator Protocol

This reference codifies the stance `qa-execution` Step 4A takes when auditing AI-implemented work. It exists because the agent that wrote the code interprets its own output charitably — and a self-report is not evidence.

## Principle

> The agent that wrote the implementation and the agent doing this audit are distinct evaluation contexts. The auditor never accepts the implementer's self-report as evidence.

This is not about distrust of the model. It is about how context affects evaluation: an agent that just spent two hours building a feature reads ambiguous output as success. An auditor reading the exit code, the diff, and the test file at its current state does not.

## What counts as evidence

- Fresh re-execution of the smallest public proof (CLI invocation, HTTP request, browser flow, worker job) against the current state of the repository.
- Direct read of the test file at its current commit, matched against the literal acceptance criterion using the Requirement → Test mapping defined by the AI Implementation Audit reference (loaded separately from SKILL.md, not via this file).
- Static analysis of the diff since the task baseline (`git log --follow <test_file>`, `git diff <baseline_sha>..HEAD -- <test_file>`).
- Successful exit codes from canonical commands recorded with timestamps in `verification-report.md`.

## What does NOT count as evidence

- The implementing agent's transcript or chat log claiming success.
- A "done" or "all green" message in `memory/<phase>.md`.
- A checkbox marked `[x]` in `task_NN.md` body or `_techspec.md`.
- The frontmatter `status: completed` field by itself.
- A test run whose output was discarded or summarized by the implementing agent.
- A PR description or commit message asserting that tests pass.

## Sequence

When auditing a task under `.compozy/tasks/<slug>/`:

1. **Read the implementer's artifacts before forming a judgment.** Open every `memory/<phase>.md` file the implementing agent wrote during `cy-codex-loop`. Read for: tools the agent used to bypass blockers, errors it "fixed" by deleting an assertion, fallback paths it took when the real path failed, ambiguity it resolved unilaterally.
2. **Classify anomalies** found in the transcript into one of:
   - `genuine-failure` — the agent encountered a real problem and did not resolve it.
   - `grader-bug` — the agent encountered a test or check that was wrong; the resolution may be legitimate.
   - `ambiguous-task` — the requirement was unclear and the agent picked an interpretation.
   - `bypass-exploit` — the agent found a path that satisfies the literal test but not the requirement (e.g., hardcoded an expected value, skipped a step the test did not enforce).
3. **Record classifications in `memory/qa-execution.md` → `Errors / Corrections` section.** This write happens **before** any frontmatter `status:` flip (memory-precedes-status invariant from `cy-codex-loop`).
4. **Then** apply Step 4A's normal verification — re-execute the smallest proof, read the diff, and run the AI test-hygiene Red Flag scans (RF-1..RF-6) defined in the AI Implementation Audit reference, which Step 4A.3b loads directly from SKILL.md.
5. **Then** decide the `qa_verdict`. If transcript classification surfaced a `bypass-exploit` or `genuine-failure` not addressed by the implementation, the verdict cannot be `PASS` regardless of green tests.

## Why this matters in Compozy mode

`cy-codex-loop` is built around the premise that an agent implements a task and self-reports completion via `state.yaml` and `task_NN.md` frontmatter. `qa-execution` is the independent evaluator in that loop. If the auditor accepts the implementer's framing, the loop has no real verification — only ceremonial verification — and `task_NN.md status: completed` becomes a coordination signal, not a quality signal.
